Context:
The conversation focused on improving a Technical Specification Document (TSD) for an SAP custom report on Batch Genealogy. The updated TSD now includes details for "Existing Assumptions" and "Selection Screen" sections. The final document meets the specified requirements, including descriptions, purposes, and assumptions for generating a Certificate of Analysis (COA) report, detailing data retrieval from LIPS and AUFM tables. The selection screen allows users to manually input delivery numbers with additional filters like date range, material number, and batch number. The document is ready for review and approval.
