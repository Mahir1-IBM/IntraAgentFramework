This report is to be generated for Certificate of Analysis (COA) purposes, capturing detailed batch consumption information related to Delivery and Batch. The report will fetch data from LIPS and AUFM tables to present a comprehensive view of the delivery item's batch genealogy, including the material number (MATNR), batch (CHARG), and order number (AUFNR). The TS details the logic for retrieving component batch information based on batch genealogy, where each component involved in the production of the finished product is traced through the AUFM table using the Movement type (MT) for both 261 (issue for production) and 101 (goods receipt). The report will present a single format output that includes AUFNR, MATNR, and CHARG for all materials, both the end items and components, involved in the delivery process. The TS includes the creation of a selection screen for manual report generation, where users can select the delivery number, and outlines the necessary steps for automated COA retrieval linked to specific deliveries.Purpose:The purpose of this Technical Specification document is to serve as a blueprint for the development team at IBM to create a custom SAP report that aligns with the business requirements specified by Gore. The document aims to bridge the gap identified in the Functional Specification (FS) document, namely the need for an efficient mechanism to produce and send out Certificates of Analysis with batch details to customers upon delivery. The TS provides the required technical details that facilitate the understanding, development, and implementation of the solution while ensuring that it remains within the scope of Gore's standard SAP products, albeit with necessary customizations. It does not delve into implementation details like database modeling or report names, as these are out of its scope. The primary goal is to ensure that Gore can verify that all business requirements have been adequately addressed and that they can approve the document with the assurance that the proposed solution meets their needs. Approval of the TS precedes the commencement of the actual development work.**Existing Assumptions**There are no outstanding system issues that will affect the delivery of the custom report. The required data tables (LIPS and AUFM) will be available and accessible during the development. Users have relevant Fiori access permissions to utilize the selection screens. No significant changes to the SAP QM module will occur during the development cycle.**Generated Assumptions**NA**Issues**NA**List of Custom Developed Primary Objects**Objects | Object Types | Description | Create/Change |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | **Selection Screen** Select delivery number: [Input field] Select date range: [Input field] Select batch number: [Input field] Select plant: [Dropdown menu or input field] Select material number: [Input field]TERMINATE
