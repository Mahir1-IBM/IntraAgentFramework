**Description and Purpose**

Description of Technical Specification Document:

The technical specification document is intended to outline the systematic approach for the realization of the Certificate of Analysis functionality within the SAP S/4HANA environment, focusing on the Batch Genealogy report. The document will detail the technical architecture, data model, integration points, and custom development necessary to meet the business requirements specified in the functional specification. It will include the design for a selection screen to input Delivery numbers, the logic to extract Batch and Delivery data from LIPS and AUFM tables, and the steps to trace the genealogy of batches through the production process using movement types.

The technical design will ensure that all relevant data, including Order Number (AUFNR), Material Number (MATNR), and Batch Number (CHARG), for both finished products and their components, can be retrieved and displayed in a single report format. The solution will integrate with existing SAP reports, such as COOIS for Documented Goods Movements, and will provide the capability to print the Certificate of Analysis with the necessary information extracted from the S/4HANA system, as well as from external systems such as ME/MII, where applicable.

Purpose of Technical Specification Document:

The purpose of this technical specification document is to serve as a blueprint for developers, providing detailed instructions on how to translate the business requirements presented in the functional specification into a working solution within the SAP S/4HANA framework. It aims to ensure a clear understanding of the technical aspects and the development work that will be required to implement the Certificate of Analysis feature, including custom reports and enhancements to existing functionality.

The document is intended to guide the development process, ensuring all stakeholders, including the IBM development team and Gore, are aligned on the technical approach and the expected outcomes. It will be used as a reference throughout the development lifecycle to validate that the solution aligns with the defined business needs and that all functional requirements are addressed by the technical implementation. Formal approval of this document by Gore is necessary before development can commence, ensuring that the proposed technical solution meets the business objectives and adheres to the agreed-upon standards and practices within the SAP Custom Development Methodology.

**Technical Details**

Based on the provided content, the technical implementation details for the Technical Spec document of the Report in the SAP domain would be as follows:

 1. Main Statement of Reports
The main purpose of the report is to generate a Batch Genealogy report that provides detailed information about batches, materials, and order numbers for given deliveries.

 2. Key Requirements to Achieve the Report
- Implement a selection screen to capture delivery numbers and item numbers.
- Extract data from SAP tables like LIPS and AUFM based on the selection criteria.
- Process data to derive batch genealogy details.
- Present the output in a specified format with the ability to download to Excel or other methods.

 3. Relevant Data Fields, Filters, and Selection Criteria
- Delivery Number (VBELN) - Mandatory
- Delivery Line Item Number (POSN) - Mandatory
- Material Number (MATNR)
- Batch Number (CHARG)
- Order Number (AUFNR)
- Movement Type (BWART)

 4. Data Sources
- SAP standard tables such as LIPS (Delivery items) and AUFM (Goods movements for order).

 5. SAP Tools
- ABAP Report that will be executed with a selection screen.

 6. Function Names, Classes, and Method Names
- Not specified in the content. Custom function modules, classes, or methods will need to be created as per the requirement.

 7. Important Functionalities
- Selection screen for input parameters.
- Data retrieval from LIPS and AUFM tables.
- Logic to trace back the component batch involved in the finished product.
- Output formatting and presentation.

 8. Custom Table Design and Related Fields
- Not explicitly mentioned. If needed, a custom table could be designed to hold intermediate data for processing.

 9. Custom CDS Views, Tables, Classes, Methods, and Functions
- Custom ABAP code (reports, function modules, classes, methods) will be created based on business logic relevant to the business requirement given in the functional spec.

 Technical Implementation Steps:

 Selection Screen Implementation
- Create a selection screen (`SELECTION-SCREEN`) with parameters for Delivery Number (`VBELN`) and Delivery Line Item Number (`POSN`).

 Data Retrieval Logic
- Implement an ABAP report that uses the input parameters to query the LIPS table to get related `MATNR` and `CHARG`.
- For each entry from LIPS, use `MATNR` and `CHARG` to query the AUFM table to retrieve `AUFNR`.
- Using the retrieved `AUFNR`, find all related components with movement type 261 in the AUFM table and get their `MATNR` and `CHARG`.
- For each component, check for a 101 movement type in AUFM to confirm the component's order number.
- Loop through each component to build the full genealogy of batches until there are no more 101 movements.

 Output Presentation
- Define an internal table with fields `AUFNR`, `MATNR`, and `CHARG`.
- Populate the internal table with processed data.
- Display the data using ALV grid or download to Excel as per output requirements.

 Reconciliation and Verification
- Implement logic that allows the report to be reconciled with the standard SAP report COOIS for documented goods movements.

 Enhancements
- No enhancements were specified in the content provided.

Please note that detailed technical specifications such as the exact ABAP code, class, and method definitions, as well as specific logic for data processing, were not included in this document as they depend on the actual SAP system configuration and business logic. These would need to be developed by an ABAP programmer in accordance with the functional requirements.

**Error Handling**

Based on the provided information, the error handling section of the Technical Specification (TS) document for an SAP S/4HANA implementation could be structured as follows:

--

Error Handling

To ensure the robustness and reliability of the system, the following error handling mechanisms will be implemented:

1. Validation of Selection Criteria: The system will perform checks to ensure that the provided selection criteria yield data. In the event that no data is found for the given selection criteria, the system will generate a meaningful error message to inform the user. This message will prompt the user to revise the selection criteria or check the underlying data.

2. Monitoring Record Counts: The system will keep track of the number of records processed. If an unexpected record count is encountered (either zero records or an unexpected number of records), the system will log an error and notify the responsible personnel through the configured alert mechanism. The notification will include details about the job, selection criteria used, and the expected versus actual record count.

3. Testing Procedures:
   - Error-Free Run: Prior to deployment, the system will be tested to ensure that processes can complete without errors when provided with correct input data.
   - Exception Processes: Exception handling procedures will be tested to validate that the system can gracefully handle and recover from errors. This includes verifying that the system captures all relevant information about the exception and provides it to the users or logs it appropriately.
   - Error Handling Mechanisms: The system's ability to detect, log, and notify errors will be rigorously tested. This will ensure that in the event of an error, the system responds according to the predefined error handling protocols.

4. Contingency Procedures: In case of critical errors, the system will have predefined contingency procedures. These procedures will include steps for system recovery, data rollback or restoration, and notification to the system administrators or support team.

5. Documentation and Training: Detailed documentation will be provided for all error handling procedures. Training will also be provided to the relevant users and support staff to familiarize them with the error handling mechanisms and the steps to be taken in the event of an error.

6. Support and Maintenance: An ongoing support and maintenance plan will be in place to address any errors that are identified post go-live. This will include a ticketing system for error reporting, a defined SLA for error resolution, and regular updates to error handling procedures based on lessons learned.
