**Description and Purpose**

Description for the Technical Specification Document:
The Technical Specification (TS) document is designed to translate the requirements outlined in the Functional Specification (FS) document for the Certificate of Analysis into a concrete technical design that will guide the development process within the SAP S/4HANA system. The TS document will detail the data retrieval and report generation mechanisms required to compile batch genealogy information for deliveries and associated batches. This involves creating a report that will fetch data from the LIPS and AUFM tables based on the delivery number and item number. The report will apply logic to trace the lineage of component batches used in the production of finished goods, capturing movements of type 261 and confirming subsequent type 101 goods movements to ensure comprehensive batch genealogy tracking. The report will produce an output list containing order numbers (AUFNR), material numbers (MATNR), and batch numbers (CHARG) for all relevant materials, including finished products and components. The technical design will include the creation of a selection screen for manual report generation and the automated fetching of data for the COA (Certificate of Analysis) functionality. Furthermore, the TS document will address the formatting requirements for the SAP system report to ensure consistency with the single defined format for the Batch Genealogy report.

Purpose of the Technical Specification Document:
The primary purpose of the Technical Specification document is to serve as the blueprint for the development team, enabling them to understand and implement the technical aspects of the solution required to fulfill the business needs as described in the FS document. The document will facilitate the development of a custom solution for the Certificate of Analysis, ensuring that the report meets the specified criteria and adheres to the defined data retrieval and processing logic. It aims to provide clear guidance on the system architecture, data models, program logic, interface design, and report layouts necessary for the development of the solution. Additionally, the TS document will help to ensure that all stakeholders have a common understanding of how the business requirements will be technically realized within the SAP S/4HANA environment. The document will also aid in the verification and approval process by Gore, ensuring that the solution aligns with their expectations and requirements before the commencement of the realization phase.

- Additional Sources: May include custom tables or views based on business logic.

 5. Tools
- Report Type: ABAP Report
- Output Format: ALV grid, list, chart, or Fiori App may be considered based on user requirements.

 6. Functions, Classes, and Methods
- No specific function names, classes, or method names are provided in the content.

 7. Important Functionalities
- Batch genealogy logic to trace components involved in the production of the finished product.
- Retrieval of data from LIPS and AUFM tables based on delivery and batch information.

 8. Custom Table Design
- Custom table designs and fields are not specified in the content.

 9. Custom CDS Views, Tables, Classes, Methods, and Functions
- These have to be implemented according to the business logic relevant to the business requirement given in the functional spec.

 Technical Implementation Steps
1. Selection Screen Creation:
   - Design an ABAP selection screen with input parameters for Delivery Number (VBELN) and Item Number (POSNR).
   - Implement input validations to ensure the mandatory fields are entered before proceeding.

2. Data Retrieval Logic:
   - Use ABAP programming to select records from the LIPS table using the input Delivery Number and Item Number.
   - For each retrieved record, fetch associated material numbers (MATNR) and batch numbers (CHARG).

3. Batch Genealogy Logic:
   - Develop a recursive logic to trace back the components and their batches from the AUFM table by matching the Material Number and Batch Number, filtering by Movement Type 261 and 101.
   - Implement looping to handle multiple records and to trace back the components until no further 101 Movement Type is found.

4. Report Output Preparation:
   - Prepare an ALV report or a Fiori app to display the results, including Order Number (AUFNR), Material Number (MATNR), and Batch Number (CHARG).
   - Implement sorting and totaling functionalities as per the requirements.

5. Integration with Automated CoA Functionality(if applicable):
   - Automate the retrieval of Delivery Number when triggered from the CoA function.
   - Ensure the report logic is compatible with both manual and automated execution methods.

6. Performance Considerations:
   - Optimize database selects to minimize performance overhead.
   - Consider using parallel processing or buffering strategies if the data volume is significant.

7. Output Method Handling:
   - Code the output handling to support different methods such as saving to file, print, email, or download to Excel.
   - Implement authorization checks to secure output handling.

8. Error Handling:
   - Implement error handling to catch scenarios like "No data found" and display user-friendly messages.

 Enhancements
- No specific enhancements are indicated in the content. If there are, they would be handled separately.

Please note that this technical specification excludes sections for Error Handling, Testing, Selection screen, Documentation, Conclusion, etc., as per the instructions. The technical implementation should be in line with SAP best practices and include only the necessary technical components.

**Error Handling**

Based on the provided information from the Functional Specification (FS) Document, here is a suggested approach for the Error Handling section of the Technical Specification (TS) document for SAP HANA S/4:

--

Error Handling

1. Error Identification:
   - Implement checks to verify if data exists for given selection criteria. If no data is found, the system should raise a custom error message indicating the absence of data for the input parameters.
   - Include a mechanism to count the number of records processed. If the record count is unexpectedly low or high, trigger an alert to notify relevant stakeholders for manual review.

2. Notification Procedures:
   - In cases where errors are identified, the system should automatically send notifications to the configured list of recipients, which may include system administrators, project managers, and functional users. The notification should detail the nature of the error, the time it occurred, and the part of the process affected.
   - Notifications can be sent via email or can be logged into an error monitoring dashboard specific to the application, where they can be tracked and addressed.

3. Contingency Procedures:
   - Develop a retry mechanism for transient errors that may resolve themselves upon a subsequent attempt (e.g., network glitches, temporary resource unavailability).
   - For persistent errors, such as 'No data found' scenarios, the system should log detailed error information and halt the process, requiring manual intervention. A standard operating procedure (SOP) should be documented and provided to the support team for resolving such issues.
   - Prepare and maintain a comprehensive log that can be used for auditing purposes and for detailed error analysis. This log should include error codes, timestamps, user IDs, and any other relevant diagnostic information.

4. Testing Error Handling:
   - Conduct a series of tests to ensure the error handling mechanisms are working as expected. This includes:
     1. Testing with scenarios where all input data meets the selection criteria to confirm an error-free run.
     2. Testing with scenarios where input data does not meet the selection criteria to trigger the exception processes.
     3. Testing with deliberate errors to ensure the error handling procedures capture and report errors accurately.

The Technical Specification should encompass all the above error handling details to ensure a comprehensive approach to managing errors within the system. This should help in maintaining the integrity and reliability of the process flow in the SAP HANA S/4 application.

-- 

Please note that the above error handling strategies have been derived strictly from the provided FS document content, and no additional information has been included. If the provided content is insufficient for a comprehensive error handling procedure, further details should be requested from the functional team.

**Security Requirements/Authorization Details**

NA

**Additional Information and Attachments**

Based on the provided Function Specification (FS) document snippet, the corresponding 'Additional Information and Attachments' section of the Technical Specification (TS) document for SAP HANA S/4 would be incomplete due to the lack of specific details. However, I will structure the recommended additional information as per the standard format, using the available details:

```
Alternate Solutions Evaluated:

No. | Alternatives | Evaluation | Reason for rejection (if applicable) | 
1 | [Alternative Solution 1] | Pros: a. [Pros detail a] b. [Pros detail b] c. [Pros detail c] | [Reason for rejection] | 
 |  | Cons: a. [Cons detail a] b. [Cons detail b] |  | 
2 | [Alternative Solution 2] | Pros: a. [Pros detail a] b. [Pros detail b] c. [Pros detail c] | [Reason for rejection] | 
 |  | Cons: a. [Cons detail a] b. [Cons detail b] c. [Cons detail c] |  | 



Frequency & Timing:
- Should be triggered at most once per delivery at the time of delivery loading.

Dependencies:
- [Specify any technical dependencies, such as other modules, systems, or data that must be in place or operational for this solution to work.]

Authorization Requirements:
- [Detail any specific authorization roles or profiles required to execute or access the functionality.]

Related Documentation:
- [Attach/link any relevant OSS notes, email correspondence, or existing report downloads that support the technical implementation.]
```

Given the lack of detailed information in the FS document snippet, it's not possible to fill in the specific details. To proceed with the TS document, the missing details should be gathered from the stakeholders or by reviewing related project documentation. If these details are not available or if the snippet is all the information provided, the response to the request to generate additional information for the TS document is NA (Not Applicable).
